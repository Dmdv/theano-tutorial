# Theano/Lasagne tutorial

This is a quick intro to [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and a bit of [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) libraries. It walks through some basic concepts with toy implementations of some ML alrogithms.

The code was used for this [post](https://habrahabr.ru/company/ods/blog/323272/) and this lecture I gave to the students of MSU/Technosphere (in russian):
